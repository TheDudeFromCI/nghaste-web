                    NG-HASTE generates algorithms through the act of growing
                    node graphs. A node graph is a collection of nodes and
                    connections which describe how information should be
                    passed through a algorithm. Each node can be thought of as a
                    function while each connection can be thought of as data
                    object being passed around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the image to the right, we have an example of a simple
                    node graph. Each box represents a function while each
                    connection between the boxes represents data flowing from
                    function to function. Each function takes in a set of input
                    variables and exports a set of output variables. NG-HASTE
                    doesn't care about what the implmentation of a function is,
                    simply what goes in and what comes out. (Additional
                    optimizations can be made by allowing axioms to know the
                    implmentation, but this is not required. More detail
                    explained later.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the sake of simplicity, this example only shows
                    variables being used once when passing between functions,
                    however, variables can be used any number of times by adding
                    more connections. When creating connections, an output
                    variable coming from a function can be used any number of
                    times. However, an incoming variable to a function may only
                    have one value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While there are many different ways a node graph can be
                    created or used, NGHASTE has a few specific rules for what
                    determines whether or not a node graph is valid. An invalid
                    node graph will never be proposed as a solution.

                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The graph cannot contain any circular dependencies.
                        <ul>
                            <li class="subnote">
                                No output of a node cannot directly or
                                indirectly connect back into it's inputs.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All inputs of a function must be satisfied for the graph
                        to be complete.
                        <ul>
                            <li class="subnote">
                                If a function requires two inputs, but only one
                                is provided, the graph is considered
                                uncompilable.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is only one output node.
                        <ul>
                            <li class="subnote">
                                This node can still have any number of input
                                parameters. The purpose of this node is to
                                determine the shape of the tree and can be used
                                to run the tree to determine its state.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No node is considered part of the graph unless at least
                        one output is used.
                        <ul>
                            <li class="subnote">
                                This excludes the output node. For all other
                                nodes, the node is simply ignored if it's not
                                being used. If you need to preform a function on
                                an object that returns no value, the function
                                can simply return the object it acted upon.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h5>Parsing a Node Graph</h5>
                <p>
                    Parsing a node graph is very simple and straight-forward.
                    Information is always moving from left to right. The order
                    in which functions are executed doesn't matter, as long as
                    all parent nodes of a function are executed before the
                    child. After all, you can't pass inputs to a function unless
                    you know what those inputs are. Each connection is a value
                    type variable, so we never have to worry about race
                    conditions if we decide to parallelize the function.

        <h2>The Search Tree</h2>

        <p>
            The main function of NG-HASTE is the search tree. By taking the full
            search space of all possible algorithms that can be generated and
            forming those into the shape of a search tree, we can search through
            it much easier. It also allows us to prune out branches which won't
            help us or prioritize branches that will help more.
