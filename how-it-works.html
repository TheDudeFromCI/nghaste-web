                    NG-HASTE generates algorithms through the act of growing
                    node graphs. A node graph is a collection of nodes and
                    connections which describe how information should be
                    passed through a algorithm. Each node can be thought of as a
                    function while each connection can be thought of as data
                    object being passed around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the image to the right, we have an example of a simple
                    node graph. Each box represents a function while each
                    connection between the boxes represents data flowing from
                    function to function. Each function takes in a set of input
                    variables and exports a set of output variables. NG-HASTE
                    doesn't care about what the implmentation of a function is,
                    simply what goes in and what comes out. (Additional
                    optimizations can be made by allowing axioms to know the
                    implmentation, but this is not required. More detail
                    explained later.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the sake of simplicity, this example only shows
                    variables being used once when passing between functions,
                    however, variables can be used any number of times by adding
                    more connections. When creating connections, an output
                    variable coming from a function can be used any number of
                    times. However, an incoming variable to a function may only
                    have one value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While there are many different ways a node graph can be
                    created or used, NGHASTE has a few specific rules for what
                    determines whether or not a node graph is valid. An invalid
                    node graph will never be proposed as a solution.

                    <li>
                        The graph cannot contain any circular dependencies.

                                No output of a node cannot directly or

                        All inputs of a function must be satisfied for the graph

                                uncompilable.
                            </li>

                                This node can still have any number of input
                                parameters. The purpose of this node is to
                                determine the shape of the tree and can be used
                                to run the tree to determine its state.

                        No node is considered part of the graph unless at least

                                used. If you need to preform a function on an
                                object that returns no value, the function can
                                simply return the object it acted upon.

                <h5>Parsing a Node Graph</h5>
                <p>
                    Parsing a node graph is very simple and straight-forward.
                    Information is always moving from left to right. The order
                    in which functions are executed doesn't matter, as long as
                    all parent nodes of a function are executed before the
                    child. After all, you can't pass inputs to a function unless
                    you know what those inputs are. Each connection is a value
                    type object, so we don't have to worry about race conditions
                    if we decide to parallelize the function, or sorting issues
                    if we process things in a strange order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most common way to parse a node graph is to start at the
                    output node. For that node, check if all parent nodes have
                    been executed. If not, recursively call all parent nodes and
                    check if their parents have been run. Once all parents have
                    been executed, the target node can be run using the provided
                    inputs. We can see this below with some Python Psuedocode.
                </p>

                <pre class="m-4"><code class="lang-python pt-3 pb-1">
                    # First, we create a temporary list of finished nodes.
                    # This shows us what nodes we've already calculated.
                    finishedNodes = []

                    # Next, we create an empty dictionary which pairs output
                    # plugs to what value they are holding after nodes are executed.
                    plugValues = {}

                    # The execute method runs a node function with a list of parameters
                    # and stores the returned tuple back into the plugValues dictionary.
                    def execute(node):

                        # Create a list of the parameters we will pass to the function.
                        parameters = []

                        # For each input plug, retrieve the value of the output plug
                        # which is connected to it.
                        for plug in node.inputs:
                            value = plugValues[plug.parent]
                            parameters.append(value)

                        # Run the node function.
                        returned = node.function.run(parameters)

                        # Lastly, store all new values back into the dictionary.
                        for i, plug in enumerate(node.outputs):
                            plugValues[plug] = returned[i]

                    # This method recursively executes the target node and all its
                    # parent nodes.
                    def calculateValues(node):
                        # If we've already calculated this node, do nothing.
                        if node in finishedNodes:
                            return

                        # Calculate all parent nodes, first.
                        for parent in node.parents:
                            calculateValues(parent)
                        
                        # Execute this node, and add it to the finishedNodes list.
                        execute(node)
                        finishedNodes.append(node)

                    # Now we simply calculate the values of the output node.
                    outputNode = graph.outputNode
                    calculateValues(outputNode)

                    # We can freely read the outputs from the plugValues dictionary.
                    print(plugValues[outputNode.outputs[0]])
                </code></pre>

                <p>
                    For objects which use branching inputs, such as loops or if
                    statements, you can skill processing parameters which
                    wouldn't be called, otherwise. In an if statement, for
                    example, you would calculate the conditional parameter
                    input, and depending on whether it evaluates to true or
                    false, calculate values for only one of the two branches.
                    This will allow you to save a lot of overhead in much larger
                    node graphs.
                </p>

                <h5>Dealing with Object Values</h5>

                <p>
                    As stated above, all objects are treated as value types.
                    This is important as connections can be made to multiple
                    other functions at once. Reference types would introduce
                    sorting dependencies and would potentially lead to
                    unexpected results in many cases. To combat this, by dealing
                    with value types, each function soley interacts with a given
                    set of input values and exports a new set of values. A
                    function must always produce the same output if given the
                    same inputs. In addition, a function cannot interact with
                    objects outside of itself in any way. If modifying the world
                    is required, it's best to pass in a world state as a data
                    type into the graph as an input function, and accept a world
                    state as an output function parameter. That world state
                    itself can contain a list of actions which should be
                    preformed on it, in order, to be executed after the graph
                    has returned the final value. Let's take a look at a more
                    visual example.
                </p>

                <img src="images/movement-ai.svg" width="100%" />

                <p>
                    In the example above, you can get a better visualization of
                    how information is passing through a node graph and how
                    decision are being made. Here, we have a simple program in
                    which an artificial intelligence agent is deciding whether
                    it should move forward or stand still. The agent will move
                    forward if it has not reached the goal, and will stand still
                    if it has reached the goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This graph just deals with three different data types, as
                    shown in the key. The world state describes what the state
                    of the world would look like if that branch is taken. This
                    can be seen at the if statement function where there are two
                    existing copies of the world state. One where the agent has
                    preformed no action and one where the agent has moved
                    forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In practice, the world state can by insanely large. Creating
                    a complete copy of this for every function would chew up a
                    lot of resources. It's far more likely the world state would
                    be implemented in a manner closer to this:
                </p>

                <pre><code class="lang-python">
                    # This is the world state object. We'll make a new instance of this
                    # for each connection.
                    class WorldState:
                        def __init__(self, world, actions = []):

                            # won't edit it, so we can safely move this instance around
                            # without having to create new ones each time.
                            this.world = world

                            # We'll initialize our list of actions to be empty.
                            this.actions = actions

                    This gives us a significantly more useful method of managing
                    data types within a graph. In addition, we can now see how
                    object oriented programming can be implemented into a node
                    graph. Simply turn each method of a class into a function,
                    taking the object itself as both an input and an output.

        <h2>The Search Tree</h2>

        <p>
            The main function of NG-HASTE is the search tree. By taking the full
            search space of all possible algorithms that can be generated and
            forming those into the shape of a search tree, we can search through
            it much easier. It also allows us to prune out branches which won't
            help us or prioritize branches that will help more.
