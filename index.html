                    Designed to compliment neural network based algorithms, NG-HASTE aims to build a foundation in
                    logic-based machine learning by means of generating unit tests and then writing and tweaking
                    algorithms to pass those unit tests. As the AI learns more about the problem, solutions become more
                    reliable and effcient. Code generated by the AI can then be reused indefinitely.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While a neural network may excell at tasks such as calculating the forces and velocities required to
                    move an arm and push a button, NG-HASTE is designed to figure out that the button needed to be
                    pushed in the first place.

        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>
            NG-HASTE is a program which can be used to generate code at runtime. More specifically, algorithms which
            solve problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            The program is designed to take in a stream of unit tests, then search for a solution which meets passes all
            tests. These tests can be generated at runtime and passed to NGHASTE, which can run as a background service.
            As flaws or bugs are discovered in the generated algorithm, new unit tests can be generated and further
            tweak the algorithm to be more stable. Once this algorithm is generated, it can be compiled into regular
            program code dynamically and reused continuously. Even across shutdowns and restarts! You can even keep
            searching for solutions after one is discovered to find more optimized solutions, possibly solving the
            problem faster or using less resources.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>What was the inspiration behind this project?</h2>

        <p>
            This project was inspired by the need to solve problems which arise at runtime, without needing to write a
            solution for each problem. In the field of artifictial intelligence, there are problems which neural
            networks are extremely good at solving, such as image recognition or vector manipulation. While other
            problems, such as problem solving and strategizing are much more difficult to achieve. This project aims to
            work alongside other machine learning algorithms to target areas which involve logical processing and
            planning ahead. While a neural network might excell in determining the velocities and forces to apply to arm
            joints and push a button, this project aims to target the act of realizing the button needs to be pressed to
            open a door and continue.
        </p>

        <p>
            As the program generates code which is permanitly reusable, standard training phases and optimization phases
            still apply. Instead of this program being used to solve a Rubiks Cube, it could instead be used to write an
            algorithm to solve all Rubiks Cubes. If a solution fails to solve the cube in a specific instance, a test
            case can be generated and passed back to ensure it doesn't happen again.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>

        <p>
            At it's core, NGHASTE works as a search tree which attempts to sift through all possible algorithms that
            could be written up to a given complexity value. The tree is structured in such as way so that if one node
            fails a test, then all child nodes are also garenteed to fail that test. Through this method, the search
            space can be drastically narrowed down to only consider relivant combinations. On top of this, a set of
            heuristics can be applied to prioritize searching nodes which are more likely to contain a solution within
            the remaining search space.
